\section{Background - Possibly Rename to something domain specific like
`Octopus Analysis'}
\label{sec:background}

Expand on the problem domain if necessary to adequately describe the
problem and the solution. If the problem domain is not visualization, describe
enough about it so non-experts (those whose expertise is in visualization and
not the problem domain) can understand the problem and the design choices
made. Consider what information is needed to apply your solution to other
similar problems.

If you have task and data abstractions, you may want to describe them here and
thus would describe the data here. General assumptions about the data format
and character should be described somewhere but the choice is up to you.
Details of a specific dataset might go into case studies, but the general
assumptions about the data should go elsewhere, perhaps here.

Don't be afraid of using figures here if they would help the reader.
