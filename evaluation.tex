\section{Evaluation: CHANGE ME -- might be 'Case Studies' or 'User Studies' or
'Results' (if a controlled experiment) or just 'Evaluation'} % or "Research Plan"
\label{sec:vis}

Describe your evaluation and/or results here. 

\subsection{Usage Scenario}
\label{sec:usage}

This subsection is where we deviate from the format so the instructor has a
better idea of what you've done -- if designing a new visualization, describe
a usage scenario here. If your project is an experiment, an earlier section
should describe what you intend the users to do and/or what the users did in
your pilot study. You should still describe your ideal plan for evaluation
below. If you have case studies or user studies, put this subsection in the
visual design section instead. 

\subsection{Evaluation Plan}
\label{sec:plan}

You may not have gotten to this portion of the project -- in that case,
describe what the evaluation plan would be for this project.
