\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Discuss the work related to your project -- include both visualization and
domain-specific references to the problem you're trying to solve. What do
these solutions do and in what ways are they insufficient for the problem you
are trying to solve. Do you build on any of these? If so, how?

For example, if my work has to do with Perfopticon~\cite{Moritz:2015:EuroVis}
or comparing request flows~\cite{Sambasivan:2013:InfoVis}, I would want to
cite them. ACM Digital Library makes it easy to get bib files for final.bib
and there are guides online for citing books~\cite{ware:2004:IVP},
theses~\cite{levoy:1989:DSV}, journal articles~\cite{Lorensen:1987:MCA}, and
conference proceedings~\cite{Nielson:1991:TAD}.
